# Transaction Manager

Concurrent Transaction Manager in Java.

Manager has to provide atomicy and isolation for transactions. My task was to implement provided [TransactionManager](src/cp1/base/TransactionManager.java) interface. Code written by me is located in [solution](src/cp1/solution) directory.

Project was written as MIM UW Concurrent Programming course assignment. Task description (in Polish) can be found [here](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~iwanicki/courses/cp/2020/).
